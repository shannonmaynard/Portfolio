          <h3>Project Scenario</h3>
          <p>
            The project was for a fake client our design teacher made up that
            owned a start up business offering a unique mix of cafe and lunch
            services with a large collection of second hand novels and
            literature. Budding writers cafe bookstore, a bookstore cafe in the
            heart of Vancouver, provides a safe haven to (budding) writers of
            all backgrounds to relax, converse, read and write with like minded
            souls.The overall look and feel is grass-roots yet well organized
            and should feel comfortable to users.

          p3="During our research, we discovered the unique points about Budding Writers. Most bookstore cafes didn't have modern websites (or one at all). An exception was the Indigo and Starbucks pairing they didnâ€™t provide the personal feel our clients wanted. Therefore, we attempted to take the best from our competitors and leave the rest, while focusing on BW's strengths.
